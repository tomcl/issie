| **Change port location on Custom Components** | Press `CTRL` and use your mouse to drag a port to another position on the outline of the symbol | Custom components may end up having a large number of ports. You can move them to your desired location on the outline to create nicer schematics |
| **Resizing of Custom Components** | Change `Width Scale` and `Height Scale` on the properties pane | If default sizing makes port legends overlap you can scale custom component width and height in Properties |

| **Truth Table for combinational logic** | `Simulations` -> `Truth Table` | View the truth table for a combinational logic circuit. This can be either a full sheet or a sub-set by selecting the components you want to be included in the truth table |  
| **Add a description on your sheets** | De-select all components and click on properties. Click the `Add Description` button| Sheet description will appear on the sheet list as an &#9432; button and will be displayed on properties when that sheet is used as a custom component |

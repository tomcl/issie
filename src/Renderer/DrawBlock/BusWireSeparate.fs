(*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This code implements a sheet beautify function that is designed to be called at the end of a symbol drag, 
    wire creation, etc, after smart autoroute. Therefore it has time to analyse the whole circuit and make changes. 
 
    Currently implements:
    - spread out overlapping wire segments
    - order wire segments to minimise crossings
    - order wire segments to minimise overlaps
    - allow same-net segments to overlap

    Does not implement:
    - Re-order ports on custom components, or flip other components. That would be an obvious and quite easy 
    extension.
    - Chunk together same net segments with manually routed ones in a way that makes manual movement
    - of overlapped nets simple. Not clear what is the coorrect UI for this

(*
    The segment-based optimisations can sometimes leave wires in a non-optimal state with too many
    corners. This code scans down each 9 segment wire and attempts to remove redundant corners:

    ----              ------           ------               ----
        |      ==>          |                |         ===>     |
        ---                 |              ---                  |
          |                 |              |                    |
    
    Note that these two cases are the same: two consecutive turns are removed and a 3rd turn is moved 
    as required to keep wires joining.

    The optimised wire can be accepted as long as 
    (1) it does not go inside or too close to symbols
    (2) it does not go too close to other wires.

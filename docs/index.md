      description: "ISSIE has an extensive library of schematic components available in the 'Catalogue' menu. Components include low-level gates, flipflops, and multiplexers, as well as larger blocks: RAMs, ROMs, configurable n-bit registers, counters and adders. Viewer components are used to (optionally) view simulation waveforms of nodes on sub-sheets. Wire label components allow any number of nodes on one design sheet to be connected without visible wires. More complex functions can quickly be constructed as sub-sheets and then used as a 'custom component' (found under 'THIS PROJECT'). Custom components can have shape and I/O positions altered at any time via an intuitive and fast drag and drop GUI",

        description: "ISSIE schematic component ports are connected using drag-and-drop: each connection represents a wire or bus. ISSIE has two methods of routing wires: <b>auto-routing</b> and <b>manual-routing</b>. 
        <br><br>
        Wires will all start out as auto-routed, which means that the wireâ€™s path is created automatically by the program. This path will update when moving any connected components. ISSIE also allows for manual routing, where the user may manipulate segments of the wire as desired to make the circuit more readable. Much care has been put into a user interface for routing which <i>just works</i> quickly with no learning curve.",

Hovering on a waveform name highlights its component and all connected busses on its design sheet. Any design sheet may be viewed or edited and the simulation refreshed to see changes immediately. The values in the waveform simulator can be viewed in various formats: binary, hexadecimal, unsigned decimal and signed decimal. The Waveform Simulator uses a draggable sidebar to partition screen space dynamically between waveforms and circuit.

Verilog output for simulation or synthesis is documented as part of the Verilog write process, this includes links to a <a href=\"http://bygone.clairexen.net/yosys/download.html\">YoSys</a> workflow for synthesis on FPGAs.

# What is ISSIE?

* ISSIE is **a very easy-to-use schematic editor and simulator** for hierarchical design of **digital logic circuits**. Run it and see the built-in demos for what it can do! ISSIE is targeted at 1st year university students, but would be useful teaching in schools and even for quick hardware design and test in an industrial or research environment. For the latter use case although we allow Verilog input and output these features need a bit more work.
* ISSIE was motivated because we found that industry-standard CAD systems were too complex and buggy to be learnt in labs, and when learnt still nasty to use. Other educational products were too limited. We wanted **a schematic-based system to teach hierarchical design and digital electronics visually that would scale to large designs**.
* ISSIE is an **open source project at Imperial College London developed over 5 years by students**. The code is cross-platform and binaries are released for Windows and Silicon (Arm64) Mac targets.
* ISSIE is implemented using nearly 46K lines of F#, the equivalent of 150K lines in a typical OOP language. ISSIE has **its own digital simulator**.
* ISSIE can generate Verilog output to drive FPGAs and has an integrated system to do this directly using the **ISSIE-Stick** hardware.
* For acronym geeks, ISSIE stands for: *Interactive Schematic Simulator with Integrated Editor*.


# Running ISSIE

Go to the [latest ISSIE release](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/releases/latest). Scroll down this page till at the bottom you find the `Assets` section - this has binaries for Windows and Macos PCs. Download the appropriate one and unzip it anywhere (or add the dmg file to applications under Macos by double-clicking). No installation is required - ISSIE runs from the unzipped files under windows if you double-click the top-level `ISSIE.exe` file with the blue ISSIE chip icon. 

# Help and User Guides

             The waveform viewer was created \
             by Edoardo Santi (EEE 3rd year) during Summer UROP work. The new F# schematic editor \
             was written as 2021 coursework by HLP students in EEE, \
             and particularly Team 4. The new editor was integrated \
             by Jo Merrick (EIE 3rd year) for her BEng final year project. \
             In Spring 2022 the HLP class implemented a draw block with component rotation and much better routing. \
             In Summer 2022 Jason Zheng rewrote the waveform simulator, Aditya Despande wrote the truth table generator, \
             and Archontis Pantelopoulos spent all Summer on a UROP writing the Verilog entry block and making many improvements. \
             In 2023 HLP students implemented intelligent routing, Yujie Wang made the simulator faster, and Petra Ratkai \
             implemented a much better Verilog compiler."

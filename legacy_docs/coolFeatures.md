# Features list

ISSIE provides numerous features to help you create nice and readable schematics. These are analysed in the table below:

| Feature | How | Explanation   |
| :----:      |    :----:   |    :----:     |
| **Change port location on Custom Components** | Press `CTRL` and use your mouse to drag a port to another position on the outline of the symbol | Custom components may end up having a large number of ports. You can move them to your desired location on the outline to create nicer schematics |
| **Resizing of Custom Components** | Change `Width Scale` and `Height Scale` on the properties pane | If default sizing makes port legends overlap you can scale custom component width and height in Properties |
| **Move component's label** | Simply drag the component's label to your desired location on the canvas | |
| **Rotate and flip components** | `Ctrl + left arrow`: <br> `Ctrl + right arrow`:  <br> `Ctrl + up arrow`:  <br> `Ctrl + down arrow`: | Rotate clockwise <br> Rotate anti-clockwise <br> Flip vertically <br> Flip horizontally |
| **Truth Table for combinational logic** | `Simulations` -> `Truth Table` | View the truth table for a combinational logic circuit. This can be either a full sheet or a sub-set by selecting the components you want to be included in the truth table |  
| **Add a description on your sheets** | De-select all components and click on properties. Click the `Add Description` button| Sheet description will appear on the sheet list as an &#9432; button and will be displayed on properties when that sheet is used as a custom component |
| **Themes** | `View` -> `Theme` | Choose between the 3 supported themes: `Grayscale`, `Light` or `Colourful`  |
| **Grid** | `View` -> `Toggle grid` | Choose whether you want the grid to appear on your sheets  |
| **Wire Type** | `View` -> `Wire Type` | Choose between the 3 supported wire types: `Jump`, `Radiussed` or `Modern` wires  |
| **Wire Arrows** | `View` -> `Toggle Wire Arrows` | Choose whether you want arrows at the end-points of your wires to demonstrate the direction of signals |
| **Auto-routing** |     | Issie will **nearly always** route and separate all schematic connections neatly with no manual routing required. |

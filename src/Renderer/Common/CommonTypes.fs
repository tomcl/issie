    (*
    Note on Ports. Ports are used throughout Issie to represent I/Os of components.
    Because a design sheet can be instantiated as a component they can also represent I/Os of a sheet.

    1. Port records are used on both connections and components, a connection
       source or target port will have port Id matching that of the port on the
       component it connects to. All ports also specify the componentId of the
       component they are on (HostID).
    2. Port records on connections do NOT have port numbers, note this means that connection ports
       cannot be the same as the corresponding component port.
    3. Port numbers on components are contiguous from 0 separtely for input
       and output ports.
    4. Port numbers must match with the index of the port in the corresponding component
       InputPorts or OutputPorts list
    5. For custom components port numbers match index of the port in InputPortNames,OutputPortNames
    6. For symbols port numbers determine the vertical order in which ports are displayed.
    7. Thus when changing the order of number of I/Os on a custom component port numbers can be changed
       as long as port lists and port name lists are similarly re-ordered.
    8. In the simulation port numbers are not relevant for custom comps - connections match port names with the 
       sheet input or output component for the port
    9. In the simulation port numbers matter for all other ports: the simulator defines operation based on them.
    10.In model.Symbol ports are kept in a single global map, including port numbers. If port numbers are permuted on
       custom components the port numbers in this map must be changed. However this will normally happen since
       model.Symbol symbols and ports are changed at the same time by AddSymbol or deleteSymbol or LoadComponents
       messages.

# Updating the documentation

### Introduction

The ISSIE documentation is generated by [fsdocs](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) from Markdown documents using a Github action build `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This action outputs a static website as generated by `fsdocs` to the root directory on the `gh-pages` branch of the repo. Changes to this branch are automatically deployed to the documentation website.

 To change the documentation PR the markdown files to ISSIE `master`, rebuilding will be automatic when the changes are committed to `master`.

The Markdown source files can be found on the ISSIE repo:

* Documentation Pages: `/docs/*.md`
* ISSIE Blog Pages: `/docs/updates/*.md`
* Embedded (PNG) graphics: `/docs/img/**/*.md`
* In documentation source files the file path separator is always `/`

### How to develop documentation

For developer preview of changes  use `dotnet fsdocs watch --noapidocs` in the repo root directory. The documentation (without API) will be generated and a browser window opened to preview. Changes will get reloaded automatically. 

See [Issue 532](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/issues/532) for more details of why watch does not work with API.

PR to ISSIE master the changed documentation.


### Gotcha

Documentation builds for ISSIE need a secret key on the repo generated as documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/wiki/0-Project-Documentation-Website).

This must be regenerated every 6 months or so and uploaded to the repo.

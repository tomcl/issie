<h1> What is ISSIE? </h1>
<p>
<b>I</b>nteractive <b>S</b>chematic <b>S</b>imulator with <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>E</b>ditor <b>(ISSIE)</b> is a very easy to use desktop application which supports 
digital circuit design and simulation. 
It is targeted at both novice University and professional users who want to implement and test high productivity hierarchical digital circuit design.
Issie is designed to be beginner-friendly and guide the users toward their goals via clear UI signposting, error messages that explain how to correct the error, 
and visual clues. A design aim is to make Issie scalable. 
It is intuitive to use with small 
single-sheet circuits and also highly productive debugging complex CPU designs made from 50 sheets and hundreds of thousands of components.
The motivation for Issie was the observation that during digital lab work in EEE, previously, more time was spent learning to use (or cope with subtle bugs in) 
large commercial hardware design tools, 
than was spent learning digital design. We wanted a tool as powerful as those commercial packages which was more productive.

        <li> Issie is developed as an open source project mostly by 3rd and 4th year EEE students at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> </li>
        <li> Issie has been well tested on hierarchical designs with up to 15,000 schematic components. We expect it to be performant on much larger designs as well. 
            The simulation speed is approximately 50,000 component-clocks per ms (on an 11th gen Intel laptop). 
            Thus a circuit with 1000 components would run at 50,000 clocks per second. Issie creates fully synchronous circuits 
            with a single clock: logic with asynchronous loops is currently not supported (a feature, since 95% of the time asynchronous circuits cause trouble) 
            although this is on the roadmap for possible implementation in 2023-4. </li>
        <li> Issie designs can be exported to Verilog and synthesised on FPGAs with a simple workflow. </li>
        <li> User-friendly design entry using a restricted subset of Verilog is supported as an alternative to implementing combinational logic using gates. It is a 
            lot of work implementing a full verilog compiler with Issie's user-frindly error messages, currently the Verilog support is incomplete. We have
            better Verilog support on the roadmap.</li>
        <li>The application comprises about 42K lines of F#, a functional programming language taught by the EEE department 
            in the module <b>High Level Programming</b>, which gets transpiled to JavaScript via the <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a> 
            compiler and the <a href="https://elmish.github.io/">Elmish</a> web framework. <a href="https://www.electronjs.org">Electron</a> 
            is then used to convert the developed web-app to a cross-platform application. </li>
        <li> Issie is in active use teaching a cohort of 200 1st year students at Imperial College in the EEE department's Digital Electronics 
            and Computer Architecture module.</li>
        <li> Many 1st year students enjoy using Issie so much that they are inspired to learn F# and help developing Issie in the Summer vacation!</li>

// The fast simulation components are similar to the issie components they are based on but with addition of arrays
// for direct lookup of inputs and fast access of outputs. The input arrays contain pointers to the output arrays the
// inputs are connected to, the InputPortNumber integer indexes this.
// In addition outputs are contained in a big array indexed by epoch (simulation time). This allows results for multiple
// steps to begin built efficiently and also allows clocked outputs for the next cycle to be constructed without overwriting
// previous outputs needed for that construction.
//
// For reasons of efficiency Issie's list-style WireData type is optimised by using integers as bit arrays.
//
// For ease of implementation Input and Output components are given a single output (input) port not present on issie.
// this allows sub-sheet I/Os to be linked as normal in the constructed graph via their respective Input and Output connections.
//
// Although keeping input and output connections in the new graph is slightly less efficient it makes things simpler because there is a
// 1-1 connection between components (except for custom components which are removed by the gathering process).
// Note that custom component info is still kept because each component in the graph has a path - the list of custom component ids
// between its graph and root. Following issie this does not include a custom component for the sheet being simulated, which is viewed as
// root. Since custom components have been removed this no longer complicates the simulation.
